# Migrate Articles from Reamaze to Docusaurus (Markdown)

This script fetches all articles from Reamaze and saves them as markdown files, organised in folders of topic names that are used in Reamaze. It adds the URL of the article at Reamaze, so you can format a redirection schema.

I've used this script for a migration from Reamaze to Docusaurus(.io), but it can be used for any purpose where you can use markdown.

Fill out the 3 configuration options below and run it.
